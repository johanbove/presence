All is well, did not have much time to write or actually collect anything really worth sharing outside of my usual Twitter posts; so here's just another "sign-of-life" post :smile:

## Work

I joined [Deloitte Digital](http://www.deloittedigital.com/de/about-us) in Düsseldorf as Front-end developer and senior consultant. Very exciting times to join a young team of great developers, UX experts and designers within a great organization like Deloitte.

## Life

- Enjoying life in our wonderful home
- Organizing fun dinner parties
- Taking my bike to work again; I even got the famous [Hövding bicyle air-bag](http://www.hovding.de/) to get to work safely
- Fantastic to be able to use [Bash for Windows 10](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/03/30/run-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/), a mini Ubuntu for instant command line work
