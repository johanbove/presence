Together with the GDG Düsseldorf gang I have been organizing the [Google I/O 2015 remote event in Düsseldorf](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/ce0gksqbf0ck94511sv5sv5hb0g) at the Simvelop offices in Düsseldorf.

Our event registrations are closed by the way! It is wonderful how many people registered but unfortunately the available space is limited and we want to keep it comfortable for all attendees.

We are doing our best to make it a great opportunity to get to know fellow developers from in and around Düsseldorf!

## The Event Stream

I figured I would also include the Event feed widget here, mostly to just check out what is going on in San Francisco.
