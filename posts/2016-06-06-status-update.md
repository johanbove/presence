# Yep, the weeks are flying by!

Another month just flew by so it's time for an update on what I have been up to since my last post...

## Visiting MA, USA

We visited our relatives across the Big Pond in [Massachusetts](http://www.mass.gov/portal/)! We loved Boston, including a fun boat trip north over the Massachusetts Bay to the quaint town of Salem.

Staying over a couple of days in Cambridge was really fun and interesting, with a special relaxing, yet educational, Sunday visit to the inspiring **MIT Museum**. [Lots of awesome stuff to see in their permanent collection](https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/explore/collections).

## Learning EmberJS

Yep, I'm [learning Ember JS](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.5.0/getting-started/quick-start)!

Using the best Single Page Application framework without having to lose time figuring out how to set up a project and getting started with build scripts etc.
