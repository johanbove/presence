description: A playlist I listen to a lot
---

As so many developers, I too enjoy listening to music when working. It helps me focus.

Here is my "coding music" playlist I keep on [Deezer](http://www.deezer.com) which I often listen to in random order.
You will find that style-wise it's pretty eclectic, lots of electronica and soundtracks, but also some piano tunes are here.

_Note that to listen to the full songs you'll need a Deezer subscription._

Hope you'll enjoy it!
