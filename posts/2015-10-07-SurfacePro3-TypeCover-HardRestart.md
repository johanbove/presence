## Fix for an issue with the Surface Pro 3 and the Type Cover 3

This is a possible solution for when your Surface Pro 3 and the connected Type Cover can't seem to find each other;

It helps in the case when the keyboard's keys don't light up when you connect it to the Surface; neither in Windows nor in the Surface's configuration menu (accessible by holding Volume-Up and the start button on cold boot) and you see that in Windows's Device Manager the *"Surface Type Cover Filter Device"* under *"keyboards"* does not show up as it is being hidden since Windows thinks it's disconnected.

## A solution

> Try holding down the Power button and the Volume up button for 15 seconds. Then, wait a few seconds, and tap the Power button again. [Note: you only have to tap the power button to turn it on, don't hold it down] Plug the Surface Pro 3 into the charger.

Took me a couple of hours to find this information so I hope someone else might find this fix quicker as the help page on Microsoft's Type Cover support page does not clearly state this action as a potential fix for the issue.
