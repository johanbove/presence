## We are living in strange, violent times

Here are a couple of my own rules and guidances I try to live my life to, in no particular order, with the attempt to do something good:

- Talk to your neighbours, try to be friends
- Keep in touch with your friends and family
- Say to your loved ones you love them every day
- Keep all channels open, even if you disagree strongly; that means tend to bridges instead of burning them
- Keep an open mind; read articles from multiple sources; [use RSS feeds](2016-06-16-sharing-my-feeds)!
- Step away from Facebook and other social media from time to time
- Listen and think before opening your mouth
- If you see something, say something
- Do it right the first time; think before you do
- Take a First Aid course
- Donate blood
- Laugh as much as possible
- Hug as much as possible
- Enjoy life everyday as good as you can
- Learn, be curious; take course online; check out [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
- Be constructive and moving-forward
- Don't hate, show compassion
- Don't judge anyone or assume you know how they feel
- Don't hurt peoples feelings
- Take care of the less fortunate; don't ignore homeless people
- Take deep, long breaths and relax
- Take care of your body, eat healthy and exercise
- Wear sunscreen :sunny:
- Share and care; give away your old stuff
- Respect authorities and police as they might save your life someday
