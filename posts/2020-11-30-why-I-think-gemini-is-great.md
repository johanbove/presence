## My reasons to support the Gemini Internet Protocol

Why do I believe Gemini is great for personal Internet presences? First of all, it's a real grass-roots initiative which I am very excited about.

If you're reading this, chances are high you are already using Gemini. But for history reasons and to share my opinions of Gemini I would like to offer you here some views of mine.

Collecting some of the strong-points of Gemini from my perspective of having some experience with Gopher and running personal websites.

## Fast and lightweight

* It's very easy on the system resources. So the protocol works really well on slower hardware without any problems. Hosting on a Raspberry Pi3 is easy-peasy.
* Since there are no fancy design in Gemini capsules, it is really optimized for low bandwidth.
* It should work really fine on a feature-phone, like for KaiOS. I don't believe there is a client yet for KaiOs at this time.
* It's fairly easy to build clients and servers for the protocol.

## Simple yet complete

* The specifications provide enough functionality to do basically what you would expect to be able to do online.
* Much lower learning curve compared to Gopher and HTML. You can start publishing Gemini pages within minutes.
* Even-though the syntax is limited, it still gives enough playroom for creative expression.
* Use of TLS certificates promises security and privacy.
* It is more international than US-centric Gopher.
* The procol supports the UTF-8 character set so any language can be used to publish sites in.
* This should help make the protocol more popular in non-ascii wielding regions in the World.

## Easy to publish

* Content will be probably first of all stored in static text files which are future-proof and easy to maintain.
* Many servers already available that require minimal technical skills.
* Yes, you still need a server, but there are many collectives which you can join to facilitate this.

## Focus

* No popups, animations, videos, sound effects.
* Focus on actual content instead of fluff and effects.
* No advertisemens and commercial tracking.
* No Facebook, Google or Twitter.

## Accessible

* Power of formatting goes into the clients or readers. Like in the good old days of the early Web, people are expected to style the content to their own liking.
* It's pure text, has simple navigation rules, so should be great for people with disabilities.
* No JavaScript so you really see what you get.

And on top of this, the young Gemini community is driven to make this a success!
