I am a somewhat active user of both Feedly and Pocket.

Since recently both great news reading tools offer the ability to easily share collections of content. While I like to think i'm sharing interesting articles I'm posting both services here in the hopes it will serve someone well.

- [My Feedly Collection](https://feedly.com/johanbove)
- [My Profile on Pocket](https://getpocket.com/@924TfA53g3e0Gp1di7d54e3d35p9g50g4f7y39ZebyP45eIem30GTa43W2agAa35)

I also keep the Twitter accounts I follow organized in [My Twitter Lists](https://twitter.com/johanbove/lists).
