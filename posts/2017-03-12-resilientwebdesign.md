A must-read book by [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/) for all **Web Workers**: <https://resilientwebdesign.com>

I found out about this book through [Marc Thiele](https://marcthiele.com/) when he mentioned it in his latest [Beyond Tellerrand](https://beyondtellerrand.com) newsletter.

At the time of writing this I'm still reading through the first chapters and after finishing only the introduction I was already convinced that this book is highly recommended for everyone working in the Web industry.

The website itself is also an interesting example of a Progressive Web App with offline support and all the features a modern web app should have today.

So go read **Resilient Web Design** right now.
