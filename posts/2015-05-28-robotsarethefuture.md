Do you know how likely it is that your job will be replaced by robots in the near future?

Do the test at "[Will Your Job Be Done By A Machine](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/21/408234543/will-your-job-be-done-by-a-machine)".

Luckily it seems that my job as a web developer is not on the line, yet, as it has a 20.6% chance of being automated according to this analysis. Still thinking the number is pretty high...

However the loomy message was lightened-up with fun animated characters depicting the evolution from humans to fully integrate android / robots in the future.

Great artwork by [@qdbui](https://twitter.com/qdbui) :star:

How fun it looks when you place them next to each other. They are having a dance-party! :smirk:
