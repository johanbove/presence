Just a couple of facts I wanted to share from the last couple of weeks. I promise i'm going to write out a couple of these projects in more detail later.

## Projects

- Got involved with the jQplot open-source project, a JavaScript library for generating graphs. I now have two forks for it. *More to follow*
- Created the [Sustainica website](http://www.sustainica.org), build upon the Zeppelin Jekyll template and Grunt. *More to follow*
- Working on these projects I gained more experience with Sass, Jekyll, Grunt, Git, GitHub and generally helping out in open-source software.

## Social

- GDG DÃ¼sseldorf is still going strong although a bit more quiet during the Summer months.

## Gear

- Still happy with the Surface Pro 3 tablet which received the Windows 10 update, which mostly rocks.
- There are still some issues open to solve. Lots of problems with the email app and some quirks regarding Cortana etc.
- Have been reporting feedback to Microsoft through the Windows Feedback app and have been gathering upvotes, but the tool lacks any way of exporting.

## Software

- Moving away from Evernote to [OneNote](http://www.onenote.com) since the editing experience and the way to work with notes is actually a lot nicer on OneNote compared to Evernote on my Windows PC. For now I am still keeping the account, in case Evernote decides to redo the Windows interface. They should redevelop the application for touch-optimized devices like my Surface. The writing experience in OneNote is just so much smoother. Heck, Evernote does not even allow two-finger scrolling! So yeah, Evernote dropped me as a user there.
- Even using OneNote on my Android phone! Keeping "snap scans" of my documents using Microsoft Lens application.
- You know what I like about Microsoft: they still have nice names for their applications. No silly names like "Messenger" or "Play", but the apps actually have more creative names like "Groove", "OneNote", "Outlook" or "Visual Studio".
- Started keeping track of my tasks, events and planning using the "[Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/)" method. I'm keeping my journal in Onenote, but also updated my physical notebook just to have some form of post-apocalyptic backup.

## Free-time stuff

- Re-activated my math training on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) to regain lost knowledge. I was never really good at math before and am really learning a lot in a fun way thanks to the Khan Academy.
- Playing Microsoft Sudoku every day to improve my number skills. Also, the "daily challenge" is addictive, yet perhaps a little repetitive.
- Started reading *Lucifer's Hammer* by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. A story about astronomers detecting a new comet. I think it's going to hit Earth. Recommended by Twit's chief Leo Laporte.
- Listening to The Guardian's Tech Weekly and Science Weekly Podcasts and the usual Twit podcasts on a weekly basis while walking to work or when I work from home.
