description: I started using TaskWarrior and TimeWarrior
---

I use TaskWarrior and TimeWarrior to keep track of my todos and time keeping. It's a fantastic command line tool, but as with any command line application, entering long commands can quickly become a nuisance. So here are my `.bashrc` aliases I use to perform often used commands with less keys typed.
