description: "What is SolarPunk?"
---

Inspired by the great article by Steve Lord on "The Dork Web". I think it explains what Solarpunk is about pretty well.

Evan Webster Wiley's "The Great Pause" film featured HackHumanity which I did not  know of before.

This is an organization I could really support, too bad they only interact on Facebook.

The article also embedded a great video on the "Economics of Star Trek", which mentions universal basic income (UBI) and a World without money.

I wished we were already there.
