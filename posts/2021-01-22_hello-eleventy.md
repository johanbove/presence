description: Migrating my blog from Jekyll and Apache SSI to Eleventy
published: "2021-01-22"

Trying out [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) as a static site generator.

Using a static site will make it possible to store this site completely on [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#http-gateways).

This should replace my current Apache SSI setup which is not easily moved to anywhere else but an Apache web server. Duh. Who thought that could happen.

Migrating my old Jekyll blog content here.

Going to see if I can get my Gemini gemlog here as well.
