I got a [BackBlaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) backup service for my main PC and just yesterday discovered they are offering [free cloud storage up to 10GB with BackBlaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html).

Sounds like enough space to [store your web app data in a secure cloud storage](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/index.html) environment.

If you'd like free months when you sign up for BackBlaze, then I'm inviting you to use this [BackBlaze Promotional referral link](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/02jtwq).

## Updates

{% plan_task "2021-01-25" %}

Using the excellent [free cloud storage software called CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/) to connect to the B2 service and easily upload files and manage folders.

Changed the name of this plan to reflect the correct purpose of Backblaze B2 - it's an archival service, not a CDN. CloudFlare and Akamai are CDNs. Microsoft Azure and Google Firebase also offer CDN services. See [this review of CDN services](https://digital.com/cdn/).

Reminds me to check out [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) too.
