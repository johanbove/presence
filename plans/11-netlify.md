Connected my Github account to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) today and I've set up a super simple test project. Netlify is really interesting! Intrigued by the authentication and form features to start and how its seems to present a better way of deploying (static) sites.

Deploying HTML and other resources is straightforward, but how would it keep developments to a connected DB in sync?

Going to have to start looking at [Eleventy](https://11ty.io/) aswell as an alternative to Jekyll. Perhaps I'll even migrate my blog over from Github pages to Eleventy and Netlify...

Those ideas will be the subject of a new plan.

Lots of new topics to cover:

- <https://Jamstack-comments.netlify.com/about>
- <https://11ty.dev/>
- [JamStack - Git centered workflows](https://www.jamstack.org/)
- [JamStack Examples](https://jamstack.org/examples/)
- [What are AWS Lambda functions?](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/)
