Getting a lot of emails from (web) services, even-though I do use a lot of them, I don't need to get emails from them on a weekly or even a yearly basis. So whenever I am getting an email which is not interesting, I simply unsubscribe. Some services and newsletters I still want to keep, if they provide me real value.
