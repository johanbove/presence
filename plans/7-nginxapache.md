Finally gotten the push to set up Nginx on my local machine as I wanted to run a CouchDB server for playing around with, but I couldn't get the SSL going. So now I have Nginx as a proxy server while also running Apache for the SHTML server-side includes.

Found good documentation on DigitalOcean's Community articles.
