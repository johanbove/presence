##  Learning what CTZN is about

Current gathering all information from Paul Frazee's CTZN project.

The source code and all information is on <https://github.com/pfrazee/ctzn>

> A distributed social network mad science experiment. **WIP.**
> Twitter-style feed and posts. Users follow each other, post to their own p2p databases, and servers aggregate their community's data to provide large-scale indexes in their own p2p databases.
> CTZN is a toolkit for political engineering. While it provides a core schema for social networks, it considers extensible "Political Experience" and application networks to be a key design goal.

Currently reading the [Design Overview](https://github.com/pfrazee/ctzn/blob/master/docs/design.md)

Paul Frazee is doing daily [live streams on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSkcL4my2wgDRFvjQOJzrlg) while he's developing the CTZN platform.
