Initially this site would only have single pages and some sub domains to hold my online experiments and some articles, but now I am going to expand this site with multiple "articles" or as I will call this content: "~/.plan".

Multi-step Thought process:

- **Content First**: what do you want to share
- **Formatting Second**: how do you present your ideas?

In Step 1. I would like to add more plans and experiments to this site. In 2., I will expand this site's articles as plans - short snippets or thought blurbs and bubbles; mostly un-edited.

As an editor I will be using [Emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/) in VS Code (requires HTML files). I've activated the [Emmet keybinding](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46854557) for quick wrapping of HTML tags.

Keeping the layout as simple as possible and the content short.

Daily log style

Every plan ends with a meta info block which shows last updated and the size of the plan entry.

Using [Apache SSI](http://dionysia.org/software/lastupdated/ssi-method.html) for this as this requires absolutely no setup or server maintenance other than keeping the file templates up-to-date.

> **Note:** Writing pure HTML is weird if you're used to writing in Markdown notation, even with [Emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/). The HTML tags are simply very distracting and I feel myself having to focus on formatting instead of the content of what I want to write.
