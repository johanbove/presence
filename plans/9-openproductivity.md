Inspired by [Noel De Martin's site](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/open-productivity), I realize that I've been setting up something similar with my _/plans_, although a lot less fancy.

So if you'd like to see what I'm up to, check out the plans in this folder.

## Updates

{% plan_task "2019-02-02" %}

Happy with the current Apache SSI setup so closing this task.

Had to fix HTML formatting issues within the task files.

{% endplan_task %}

{% plan_task "2019-02-02" %}

Noel mentioned some interesting sources for performing Open Productivity:

- <https://noeldemartin.com/now>
- [Moral letter to Lucilius](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_2)
- [Doug Belshaw's blog](https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/start/)

{% endplan_task %}

{% plan_task "2019-02-02" %}

Trying to use Apache Service Side include variables to keep track of the states of these plans, until I figure out how to build a web app to do this instead of keeping everything in shtml files. It's working for now, but of course has big limitations as the current plan files are only static html with a sparkle of SSI.

Wondering how Noel created his "/now" page system... Perhaps he build it using a PHP application?

{% endplan_task %}
