## Donate to help fun Childhood Cancer Research

## What is the impact of childhood cancer?

**Childhood cancer** strikes more than children alone, it attacks whole families too. Did you know that almost half a million children will get cancer each year, and that in Europe and the US, one child out of 5 will die within 5 years from diagnosis? Did you know that there is little funding for childhood cancer research, with many treatment protocols dating 20, 30 or even 50 years? And that these treatment protocols are more intense than the ones for adults, and can last years?

I had no idea. But now that I do know, I want to help, because children canÂ´t fight cancer alone. My fundraiser is in support of the **St. Baldrick's Foundation**, one of the most important childhood cancer research charities worldwide.

When you support them, you help fund critical trials and grants in more than 377 institutions in 30 countries.

Every cent helps.
