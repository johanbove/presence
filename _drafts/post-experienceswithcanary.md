# Outline

## Introduction

- [http://canary.is](http://canary.is)
- Refer to the Indiegogo campaign. How did it all get started?

### What is the Canary home security device? What does it do?

- Canary is a home surveillance device which looks good and is easy to set up.
- It promises plug-and-play home security for apartments or any area you want to monitor.
- Multiple devices can cover a whole house.
- Controlling, monitoring and alerts are managed through an app which runs on your smartphone. (Android or iOS).

### Who are the people behind it?

- Team in New York City.
- Adam, Jon, ...

## Buying experience

- Backed the Indiegogo campaign over a year ago. One of the most successful campaigns. Anticipation.
- How the team was communicating with backers was exceptional.
- Received the Canary.is device as announced in the mail end of February 2015. Mention how the international shipment took longer.
- Unpacking was brilliant. Beautiful packaging. Premium feel to the device itself. Stickers!

## Hardware & Setup

- Build quality and specifications
- Some initial setup issues: firmware update during first install, volume of my phone (Moto X 2014) was down.
- Hardware seems to be good although I'm not an expert. The fish-lens camera covers a surprisingly large area and the infrared lens works great in the dark. The recorded video quality in HD is good. The internal sensors seem to be working normally too: motion, temperature, humidity, air-quality, etc.
- Finding a good position to place the device proved troublesome. First placed it in the hallway but this felt too much like an invasion of our privacy. Currently the Canary found a place behind the TV where it's monitoring our hard-drives and TV computer. Not really what the device was originally was thought to surveil, but it feels safe to keep it there until the software is more mature and bugs and potential security issues are resolved.
- The sirene is really loud!

## The application (Android only)

- App was okay for installing the device but has some big problems:
  - Can't invite extra house members
  - Playing the recorded video clips is terrible. Some issues:
    - time stamp does not show seconds.
    - the playhead does not move along the playing of the video clip.
    - the video takes a long time to start playing.
  - The sirene should have an extra trigger to avoid accidental activation.
  - The air quality control should display measured values, not just graphical display of comparative air-quality.
- The app should come with "guest" modus, so people who don't need to be able to administer the app, can also install it. It is possible that the application actually already supports this. Haven't gotten to it to install the app on Erica's phone yet.
- The geo-fencing works great on my Moto-X, probably since I have location reporting turned up full.
- Wished the axiometer sensor would be used in the application as well.
- Need for access to internal log files of the devices.
- Wifi connectivity status.

## Experience & Support

- Support from the Canary Team is great. Fast Twitter response and the e-mail support seems to have caught up  with the support requests.
- It seems the device has some Wifi connectivity issues, but it's hard to check because there is no way to know the wifi strength. "How many bars". This would be super interesting to have.
- I've set up a Google+ Community for Canary users called CUCO: Canary User COmmunity. As of writing there aren't any other members yet, except for Canary's Google+ account which I personally invited. Haven't done any promotion for the group yet. Idea is to post articles to links and sites and create polls. *Wondering how I will find and invite more users?* :question:
- 2015-03-12: The device crashed last night around 21:30 and I had to do a hard reboot this morning at 6:40 by unplugging the cable and letting Canary restart. Because the servicing aspects of the application are so limited I have no idea what happened. The application does not allow access to log files or anything like that.
