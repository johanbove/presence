title: "Initiatve Q"
---

Yesterday I learned, through a Facebook post from a Friend of mine, about this new payment system that promises to become the best way to pay for and receive payments for services and goods.

The sign-up process is going a little viral as it's promising higher hard-dollar exchange amounts for people who sign up first and the sign-up is invite only.

> Initiative Q is building a new payment network and giving away significant sums of their future currency to early adopters. It’s by invite only and I have a limited number of invites.

The <https://initiativeq.com> website is really well made, including great instruction and explanation videos of what it is all about. Which was one of the reasons I personally signed up. It tickled my curiosity.

## The default Initiative Q invitation

Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of credit cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.

Here is my invite link: <https://initiativeq.com/invite/SWSfz5m6X>

This link will stop working once I’m out of invites. Let me know after you registered, because I need to verify you on my end.
