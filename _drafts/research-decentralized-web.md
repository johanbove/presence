## So how can I join this decentralized web?

### FreedomBox

- <https://www.freedomboxfoundation.org/>

> FreedomBox is a software system that powers an ultra-secure personal server built to act as a protective shield between you and the public internet. To that end, it couples a free software system with always-on, inexpensive, and power-efficient hardware about the size of a pocket dictionary. The hardware is a single-board computer that costs about 60 USD and offers the computing power of a smart phone. The software is a free and open source system available for download at no cost preloaded with many useful apps and tools designed to protect your freedom, privacy, and user rights.

#### Run FreedomBox on a VM
